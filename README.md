# luau-diassembler
ew

uh hi so basically i wrote this so u can toy with luau bytecode and shit
have fun trying to rewrite this to compile the scripts without basic knowledge lol
requires some weekly maintenence (not much albeit)

this basically will convert a luau proto back to a vanilla proto, but you'll have to modify and fix some stuff if u want a real decompiler
this was just meant to help toy with luau
